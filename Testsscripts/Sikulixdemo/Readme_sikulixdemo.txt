Hi,
this is alpha alpha.
So: How about it testing: uff 56 seconds to long for tdd. 

FAQ: Simply what is progress state of affair, unit test. Sikuli? 
Answer: We could demo out of a syncretism galery. Tbi.
Therefore the 3 aspects of the investigation are crossing each other at this point of demoing code and will furthermore continue into their own directions of:, 

to make a tdd production growing 1.

2. to have most importantly now a functional bridge for further_developement. 

3.the other
.. another eventhandling eventualality per demo facultiy: covers Prominencies: optimice the syncretiscal rhythm thing a.k.a. draw triggertime signal effort down.at bash-java-sikulipointer‘ish  way, it is right now about cheap X-server displays. 
A feature that has it is history in the seventies and the might be a history about impact on usage due so to call material implications. An prominent linux support gap is it. A bash, debian prominent supply coverage gap, too. 

We could place a disclaimer mentioning of a side effect, kind of a syncretisn, like as if some activists came and made some demo-choreography, giving rhythmic dance performance, which is not forbidden for either side, another eventhandling eventualality effort to mention anyway, ok?

It is not far to implemention, but to harden it right now already to something at least:
