This is alpha alpha, upload for early sharing, just read the code

Usage:
- the test environment is half setup, unit test __mocked
python -m unittest Testqemuburo.qemuburoTestCase.test_all_preseediso2ssh

Ran 1 test in 3189.267s

OK


Basic function: 
from downloaded debian netinstall installation image qemu installation is performed, keypressless (completely non-interactive), ready for authenticated ssh login
-Example: one can as well hold it as a but working (because tested) collection of command lines for such usecases
-Tutorial: you can read the script as a tutorial for preseeding (compare URL pointers in code)

Install 
-requirements:
-you need enough disk space, around 3g on your physical machine, default dir /tmp
### Install instruction, tested on clean vm
#as root 
apt-get install qemu
echo "yes"|apt-get install-y qemu fuseiso9660 
#as user!
cd;rm -rf qemu-buro-point-dpkg/
git clone https://github.com/qemu-buro-point-dpkg/qemu-buro-point-dpkg
export Qemuburo_install_dir=`pwd`/qemu-buro-point-dpkg/

###
Todo:
-----
code:
 -burn cd, test on physical devices (cd/usb/..?)
 -cat key thing
 - unittest 1 
 - partman control/ui: check part table,install to arbitrary part ( what does /dev/vda of official preseed.cfg mean?)
 - noise levels control design to be implemented/invented
 - sleep 100 #wait till what? till ssh up 40s, timed bash out loop
  -  $qemu -m $ram -hda $qcow2img ...: request instant time out, -extra..?
 - controll appearance and location of gui windows: thw qemu x windows: appearance on demand, fixed place
 -controll appearance of ncurses install debian dialogs: show logs
 -non interactive user anlegen
 -setup guest: bash completion, python, git,
 
Systematic usecase "gardening"
-cl iu: preseed file, model vectors, other formats qemu img, install images,
- other vms, using virsh xml
- other installmedia: mini.iso: qemu does not  
boot, why?;http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/dists/jessie/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso mini.iso	2016-09-14 00:21	28M	
- mkuron's way,
- how many usecases might span debian install more or less?, how many of ours? 

Flaw/bugs:
-regex find all 71 initrd scripts to be improved
-md5sum `find -follow -type f` > md5sum.txt
find: File system loop detected; ‘./targetisodir/debian’ is part of the same file system loop as ‘./targetisodir’.


Early logs
-mount für logging (qemu-nbd see commented)
-find ways for smarter preseed file combinations
-fine grain units at early installation level with debconf data base, stepwise unroll

Man
- Install Howto Usage manpage, 
- update/request Debian Howtos, 
- update Blog about findings and systematic and concepts, 
- finish solution mailing list thread,
- request, improve official Howtos (after got a list of what was wrong: ""syslinux" outdate, remastering out of scope, but not explained, why universal (early all, all ways) methode and no pointer EditIso, btw EditIso: false talk about root  "mount" issue), threre was mail thread complaining on presseed howtos

- write Readme: Install report on clean users machine, apt-get (double qemu?)

- write Readme (this file): comprising git clone, merge request instructions
